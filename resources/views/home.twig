			<h2>What is all this?</h2>
			<p>
				This is {{ settings.site.title | default('sleeti') }},{% if settings.site.title %} which runs sleeti,{% endif %} an attempt to convert <a href="https://eeti.me/">eeti.me</a> from procedural code to MVC with Slim 3 and Eloquent, maintained by myself, <a href="https://github.com/BytewaveMLP">Bytewave</a>. This is a personal project, mostly because Alex doesn't like MVC and I do. :)

			<h2>I own this site and don't like what this page says. Can I edit it?</h2>
			<p>
				Sure! Take a look at <code>/resources/views/home.twig</code> for the source to this page. Edit it to your heart's content!
