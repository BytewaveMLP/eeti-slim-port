			<h1>Welcome to {{ settings.site.title | default('sleeti') }}!</h1>

			<h2>What is {{ settings.site.title | default('sleeti') }}?</h2>
			<p>
				{{ settings.site.title | default('sleeti') }} is an attempt to convert <a href="https://eeti.me/">eeti.me</a> from procedural code to MVC with Slim 3 and Eloquent, maintained by myself, <a href="https://github.com/BytewaveMLP">Bytewave</a>. This is a personal project, mostly because Alex doesn't like MVC and I do. :)
			</p>

			<h2>How can I join {{ settings.site.title | default('sleeti') }}?</h2>
			<p>
				Simply click the "sign up" link in the top right.
			</p>

			<h2>I own this site and don't like what this page says. Can I edit it?</h2>
			<p>
				Sure! Take a look at <code>/resources/home.twig</code> for the source to this page. Edit it to your heart's content!
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> If the file looks scary, it's because it's using the Twig templating engine. See the <<a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation">Twig documentation</a> to figure out what exactly is going on.
